-- Calculate minimum timestamp that can be affected by the current load.
-- This timestamp is used in the MERGE statement to reduce the number of records scanned, ensuring
-- the usage of the recommended clustering key (r_timestamp :: DATE).
-- If there are no matches between the staging table and the target table, the minimum timestamp is set to the
-- current timestamp minus 4 hours. The four hours are subtracted as a "safety net" to avoid the insertion of
-- duplicate records when the first version of a given hashkey is being loaded by two processes running in parallel.
-- This is unlikely to happen, but still better to play it on the safe side.
